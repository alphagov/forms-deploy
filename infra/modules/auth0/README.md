## Overview

This module configures Auth0 tenants for authenticating users of the GOV.UK Forms admin app.

The module assumes you have already created an Auth0 tenancy. If you have not, you can [follow our wiki guide on creating Auth0 tenancies](https://github.com/alphagov/forms-team/wiki/Creating-Auth0-tenancies).
